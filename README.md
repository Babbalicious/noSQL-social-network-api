# noSQL-social-network-api

## Purpose

This is a simple backend API application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. The application uses Express.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose. The app uses the date-fns package to display times for when documents are created.

## Installation

Begin by initializing the node package module by typing "npm i" into the console. Once the dependencies are installed, the user runs the application by typing "node server.js" into the console.

## Instructions

Once the server is running, the user can use the Insomnia application to test GET, POST, PUT and DELETE routes for users, thoughts, reactions and friends.
